# VICK-Chain

_Under development...check back later_

A prototype semantic blockchain project to facilitate sharing of immunization records. VICK-Chain utilizes the [VICK knowledge graph](https://github.com/VICK-Blockchain/VICK-KnowledgeGraph) which describes the immunization records and semantic web technology to encode the immunization and consent information as a semantic blockchain. Currently this work is in development, with work in progress to simulate exchange of immunization records from synthetic data based on immunization and informed consent metadata from a dental clinic that administers the human papillomavirus vaccine.
